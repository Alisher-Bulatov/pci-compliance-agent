You previously invoked a TOOL_CALL. Here is the result of that operation:

→ Tool Result:
{{ tool_result }}

Now, based on this result, respond thoughtfully to the user's original question.

📌 Guidelines:
- Explain the result in clear, natural language.
- If multiple items are returned, group or compare them meaningfully.
- If the tool reported “not found,” ask the user to confirm the ID and (optionally) suggest nearby IDs without asserting them as correct.
- Avoid restating long requirement text unless directly relevant.
- Be professional and concise. No bullet lists or markdown unless the user asks.
