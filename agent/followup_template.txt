You previously invoked tools. Here are the observations (in order). Use them to answer the user's original question:

→ Observations JSON:
{{ tool_result }}

Now produce a final answer that:
- Explains the results clearly and concisely in plain language.
- If multiple items were returned, groups or compares them meaningfully.
- If a requested requirement was not found, explicitly say so and ask the user to confirm the ID (do NOT guess).
- Avoid restating long requirement text unless directly necessary—quote only short, relevant excerpts.
- Do not include any tool-internal metadata in the final answer.
