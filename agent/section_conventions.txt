📘 SECTION ID CONVENTIONS

In PCI DSS, requirement identifiers follow this format:
- A full requirement ID has **three parts** (e.g., `3.4.1`) and refers to a **specific rule**.
- A **section ID** has **two parts** (e.g., `3.4`) and refers to a **group of related requirements**.
- A **domain ID** has just one part (e.g., `3`) and refers to a **requirement family**.

When the user refers to a **section** (like “3.4”), you must use `get_section` to retrieve all the child requirements grouped under that section.

Examples:
- “What does 3.4 cover?” → get_section
- “Is 3.4 about access control?” → get_section
- “Show me what 3.4.1 says.” → get_requirement_text
